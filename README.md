This is an interpreter  for a very simple Java/C-ish language. The language has variables, assignment statements, mathematical expressions, comparison operators, boolean operators, class structures etc.

To use the interpreter, write your Scheme code into a text file and run <code>interpreter "name_of_file"</code>, passing the file name and location as a
command-line argument, for example:

Each statement in the source file will be evaluated in turn, and any printable results will be displayed to standard output. A few
working Scheme programs and their resulting output are shown below:
